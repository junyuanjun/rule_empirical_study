5f2d4939e1b8742bba60a1e4,SU,2,combinations were hard but questions about one thing were strightforward
5f2c831ca1dd731731121d60,SU,2,I had a scrap book next to me to use to jot down the combinations. It really helped me as I wouldn't forget and start over. The easiest ones were finding what combinations causes High/Low Risk and the hardest were finding which combinations appeared most often.
5c43724ab00b3300018f49bf,SU,2,Easy-predicting outcome Hard-Keeping track of combinations
5cd08e2ff59e0a0013563602,SU,2,The main strategy I utilized was counting which symbol was most prevalent when looking for a specific condition. This seemed to be the easiest way to go about things without making it overly confusing. 
5f4ea17781df140b24213eed,SU,4,I found it difficult to process all of the numbers at once so I looked through the rows one at a time and made a mental note of combinations 
5f3d2e6a0f32b804d33c162b,SU,4,They were all easy except Question 10 could not be predicted as had the same amount of answers in both M and H high risk categories. I counted.
5a6c076fd5d4cb0001d65a17,SU,2,"I first identified where on the chart I'm looking - when looking for value outcomes - I'm looking at the left side for all occurrences of what value or combos provided, if a single factor, it's easier to just count the number of times it shows up under H risk vs. L risk; with multiples - I do the same, but first look for only where both/all combined factors exist - and then which they showed up most for - L or H risk.  For the second part, I first only looked at the L or H risk groups based on the question, then looked for each occurrence of the factor given and what the most common value was, or first looked for the right combination of factors and what the most common value was for each in only those rows where both occurred. 
The most difficult part what keeping track of what I'd counted for each factor - but since it was limited to two combination factors at once, I was still able to keep track without writing it down. But if it was more complicated - maybe I'd need to write it down. I also used process of elimination to narrow down how many rows I even needed to look at. That also helped to simplify."
5eb19ec151b7092bae964c92,SU,1,I group them up
5ef504d47faaa01261c64983,SU,2,"It was a little like matching and keeping count. How many times you saw L, M, or H"

5f4d1bc026199998eabe619d,SU,2,All of the question types were easy accept for the ones at the end that provided the outcome and asked for the most common combinations of features in the rule. All other questions I used simple counting of the most common feature values and compared them across the two groups.
5eea8b729b444a1a0548fec2,SU,2,"Could easily remember the places of features so it took me less time than looking for it manually. Also I found some tasks hard to count when there were choices between M or H, L or M."

5ef086bbcb94ad5bd2de6ca6,SA,1,The overall task was easy. It was nice that it was connected to ML and how it works. The more ambiguous questions with varied combinations which had no clear prevailing pattern (or none that I could see clearly) were more difficult. 
5f09b598362fe7034e7c369d,SA,2,From the lesson it became intuitive to compare and count values across rows/columns within the grid. If looking at one set of values / a single column it was very easy; if the Q required comparison / assessing probability it was more difficult.

5e7760fbcce2a22c8c9698c7,SA,1,I found it easy as the instructions were clear and the methods of systematically looking at the data is logical. I was less confident when the questions were more complicated but mainly in case I had read the question wrong (e.g. read 'low risk' instead of 'high risk' so answered the question about the wrong section) rather than found the answer wrong.

5f0f0befef60ac043a1514bd,SA,4,Most questions I found easy except the common feature matching questions which I felt I only truly began to understand towards the end.

58a470a2ef58a9000119c101,SA,2,Reading the chart was easy but I found the questions about combinations harder to answer.
5f179c9df58992147642ac71,SA,2,"I felt I could answer the questions relatively well until the last few which were a lot harder. It is easiest to start at the values provided in the question and work along the table, finding values that both columns may have in common before coming to a decision. Until the last question, I also ignored blank spaces to simplify the problems."
58d0632c2fc72000011f8c57,SA,2,I simply followed the rules for a decision which involved counting the highest frequency of values and combination of values.
5f577f7ae212d4234c1d4da8,SA,2,Found the second set of questions harder where I had to see what was represented most between 2 factors.

5ee3fd6cb261520f12fb0d41,SA,2,"I looked at the features first then worked my way down the columns of the table. I found the majority of the questions easy and was able to answer them relatively quickly, but the combination questions were a bit more challenging and slightly more time consuming."
5f4286fe1e65c84670065c30,SA,2,I followed the rules as stated in the training. It was very logically.

5f22de3904d2a80008ca108a,GA,3,I went through as many possible combinations as I could and tried to figure out the most common combination from there
5f452eba7fdd360add338a96,GA,5,I found it hard comparing low/medium and medium/high and deciding on an average

5db2d023d76f07000b00349a,GA,2,Mostly I just looked along the correct section of the chart- for the ones with two values I said them aloud in my head to work out what was the most common combination 
5a0e16f0063e8600012f86b7,GA,1,I looked at the possible answers and counted the values.  In hindsight I wonder if I got one wrong though due to missing out whether it was high or low risk since I had to scroll and couldn't see the question and answers at the same time (I'm doing this on a laptop but my font size might be too big).
5f53d4f0d3e03471e4eb4847,GA,1,Only in the last combination one two thing is little difficult other looks good.

5f2ae53cfaf8ee42b43890c0,GA,2,"It took me a while to remember that Low/Medium and Medium/High counted as both, so for example if Medium/High was in abundance and there was one single High and no Medium, High would be more prominent out of the two. "

5f4eccea90113011962c0cd6,GA,4,"Comparing the chart, sometimes there were a few that were in between. And it was difficult to chose based on the significant counts of either ends (high or low)."
5ee454ad40c72e152991826e,GA,2,"The single dimension questions were very easy - they just required a simple count. The problems that involved combined dimensions were obviously harder because not every rule had a value for both dimensions. It ended up, like the other questions, being a matter of counting them in my head. "
5cc48c234bb96d00018a8bfe,GA,4,I found I had to keep looking back at the key on the side to remember what the colours meant

5f511e9381da7d30c91a46a2,GA,2,I think that once you understand how it works it’s fairly easy to answer.
5f497e30936e953c4b2ad181,GA,1,"For type 2, the hardest section was the 'combination' questions.

568eca7be3ef9e000ca208fc,GA,2,"I found practice problem 4 to be difficult -- I don't see how I was getting it wrong. The 12 actual problems were more straightforward.

With joint features, I would first see which observations had values for both, and then visually inspect what the most common for each within this subset. The other questions could be evaluated directly."

5d2464b812b27400011db6e7,GA,2,I found single features easier to work out. Considering two features in one category took much more thought. I had to re-read the question to make sure I was considering the features requested correctly then calculate by comparing the blocks across the table carefully. It was a real brain test!
5ec682b47ee9e4078e50eac7,GA,3,For the easier questions at the start I counted the combinations. For the harder questions towards the end I had to make a rough estimate because some of them were not aligned or they were equal
5b65f528055d9e00011d53f5,GA,2,Be sure to rule out as many options as possible first and then compare

5bef31aa059b3200010715dc,GA,4,When it was straight high or low they were easier but then when you had to look for the mediums too that made it harder. It was also a bit difficult with the small image to know if the middle rectangle was coloured in or not and so i wasn't too confident on those answers. for a strategy I would count up all first and just try to work it out that way then see the answers that were given for us to choose from and if it was there I would assume I got it right and pick that answer. If the answer I came to wasnt there I would try to work it out again and if i still came to the same answer I would pick the closest answer to what I got.
5f561f7de875ba2271450b22,GA,3,Found the questions asking about the risk when combining two variables slightly confusing.
5d8cef3c28e183001a335ab0,HA,4,I found the first set of questions easy to answer but the second set of questions much harder as you were comparing two sets of information eg calcium may be under medium and high risk and you don't know which part to give more weight to when comparing

5be0bf8e292b64000169a165,HA,4,"The combined values were the hardest. I just counted up the occurrences of the features in the rules, but in the combinations I wasn't as confident of getting the right answer."
5d90298097a2130015f3fa3c,HA,3,I tried studying the diagrams with what the tutorial and practices taught me. 
5f512315a90f9b305d92c8f5,HA,2,"I was counting in my head, but it was hard with the second set of questions to be sure I was isolating the correct cells - if I had access to the data I would most likely be highlighting cells to ensure I was focusing on the correct ones"
5d7369a9ff5c0e001952986e,HA,3,I found having so many different sections and to be really overwhelming and made it hard for me to compare the two sections
5f4e2cd9edde0cb197d6b0b2,HA,1,visual 
5f57c77fc54e382d46b65cfa,HA,3,Harder for combinations questions 
5f48977830f69f364ad3d331,HA,1,Track my combinations
5efa66c030577f1782e0311a,HA,2,Followed the instructions and practice questions provided. The questions I found hardest were the combination questions and found the rest relatively easy.
5eb87e96121d857d18e28e28,HA,2,I found most of the questions easy to answer. Some of the combination questions were a little more difficult.
5db0e56e95628c0011e6df82,HA,3,"The only difficult part (I think) was weighing up the frequency of different values across multiple items. In retrospect, I think I messed up the last 3 questions and wish I could look at them again (lol)."
5ecbdb76e72f9577c2ad60d6,HA,2,"followed the instructions, and double checked my answers. the hardest were where there were multiple answers on the same line - ie low+medium or medium + high"
5ef63e2638b9f0303d5e4e72,HA,5,conflicting questions gut feeling only in some machine may give error or 2 answers
5eadba3c2ee2df08c162dc70,HA,1,Went through each combination and added them up.
5f1c6da2c4f2700bd5139994,HA,2,The last 6 questions in the test were harder because there was more focus needed 
5eff6492814d8101d8ca4bcc,HA,3,"I looked at the categories on the right first (low risk or high risk) and then went to count up the # of L, M, H"
5f5174760868af3ce9a5d9f7,HA,3,Simply count how many of each section had the most. example: what had the most L's or M's in their respective column. Then refer back to the question to see what the answer is.
59b73df56039190001eaa9e7,HA,2,"I just tried to remember what I learnt from the tutorials and practice questions. I mostly found it easy, but I think I got a few wrong in retrospect."
5f4fdc5c17b4c210b9f57f4e5f4fdc5c17b4c210b9f57f4e,HA,3,it was hard to follow sometimes. i mostly used comparing and ontrasting techniues 
5f233ef24281050e715ca769,HA,2,I used the training and practice questions to aid my judgement.
5f084541958a6502a4f7233d,HA,2,used logic
5bc4784e85214800017d8c1a,HA,3,"when there were two variants and the question seemed more difficult, I would automatically look at the possible options and would eliminate 2 of the 3"
5be09f04292b640001699b20,HA,2,I tried to remember my training from the videos and the practise test. I found it hard remembering the methods but easy in some parts.
5f25c45891051f000bee3ea7,HA,2,i viewed the chart and looked for patterns. i found it relatively easy but requiring full attention.
5df22e4c361a85123b9467d0,HA,2,Locating patterns and comparing data carefully
5f2b0f0be865284c2b3fa91d,HA,2,I found it easy to find the exact points in the table I needed.
5ebc4cf20a5e67079c78776d,HA,4,i found remembering the technicalities of the model and putting it into practice
5e36fcbec0a4dc6800b82e28,HA,2,I learned from my mistake in the practice. I found the test questions easier than the training and practice. Whether that was learning by doing or overconfidence you'll know before me. I don't know it was a strategy so much as I took in the information from training and tried to apply it to the test. 
5f4d0e546aa639969e6d8701,HA,1,i studied a module in AI as I do computer science at university
5edd5ca2fa8f13101b0b0e27,HA,2,i just took my time to work it out
5f0354704532c82550263e33,HA,1,"Looked across the rows and followed them with my finger on the screen. Counted the numbers of L, M and H letters."
